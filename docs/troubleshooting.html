<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>Here is a list of the most common problems you may encounter when using silakka54 after assembling.</p>
          <h3>Random keys do not work after assembling</h3>
          <p>Check that there are no cold solder joints on the PCBs. Make sure that the diodes are positioned correctly. One reason may also be a twisted pin in the switch. Remove the switch and make sure the pins are straight.</p>
        <h3>The keyboard works but all keys are flipped</h3>
        <p>Connect the USB cable to left side, if it's connected to right side, firmware needs to be modified.</p>
        <h3>The right side of the keyboard does nothing, even when the audio cable is connected.</h3>
        <p>Make sure it's a TRRS cable and not a TRS. Many cheap cables are just TRS cables.</p>
        <h3>I tried googling "silakka", but all I get in the image search are pictures of fish</h3>
